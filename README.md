# Tentacle-Tactics
## Intro
           You have been traveing through the ocean
           blue for a while now. Nothing seems to 
           be stopping you on your lifelong journey
           to have seen every grain of sand in the
           sea. But wait...... while casually 
           sipping on some kelp juice one afternoon,
           you peer off into the distance and see 
           oncomming Tentacle creatures that you 
           have never seen before (they dont teach
           that in baoting school). You jump to your
           battle station and thank the heaven that 
           you wasted your whole life building those
           offensive mechanisms on a ship for a lost
           cause. But now who's laughing? They would
           never see the beauty and importance of this
           "lost cause" You'll show them all!!!

         by the enemy creature.

         gives out.

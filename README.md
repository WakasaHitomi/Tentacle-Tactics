# Tentacle-Tactics
## Intro
           You have been traveing through the ocean
           blue for a while now. Nothing seems to 
           be stopping you on your lifelong journey
           to have seen every grain of sand in the
           sea. But wait...... while casually 
           sipping on some kelp juice one afternoon,
           you peer off into the distance and see 
           oncomming Tentacle creatures that you 
           have never seen before (they dont teach
           that in baoting school). You jump to your
           battle station and thank the heaven that 
           you wasted your whole life building those
           offensive mechanisms on a ship for a lost
           cause. But now who's laughing? They would
           never see the beauty and importance of this
           "lost cause" You'll show them all!!!
           
###  Controls
           -  Shoot = Sapce
           -  Move = Arrow Keys(Left and Right)
           
           
        
#### Objective
         Defend from
         attacking tenticle 
         creatures.
         
         Do not get touched
         by the enemy creature.
         
         You are given 5 
         hits before your 
         ship's defense shield
         gives out.
         
##### Enemies
         You are taking out some unknown
         kind of slimy thing in the ocean
         .... 
         Now let's be honest, you didn't
         prepare yourself for this. But 
         hey! Who could blame you?! Here
         is a layout of what you're
         dealing with:
         
         ~ Red Tentacle bombers ~
            These guys will die with
           one hit from that handy 
           dandy blaster

         ~ Green Tentacle bombers ~
           These big bad bois die from
          a total of two bullets making
          contact upon their slimy, 
          oozing, and sticky skin
